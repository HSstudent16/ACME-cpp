<h2 id = "about">About</h2>

ACME is an ongoing project by HSstudent16 (alias Wogglebug) to create a simple, lightweight, yet comprehensive engine for axis-aligned physics.  Everything is based on a rectangular hitbox, and is either an "entity" which can move about and store unique properties, or a "tile" that is locked in a grid, only remembering its position and type.

This project was originally started in JavaScript, for use with web games, but has now been expanded to C++ to be useful for desktop games.  It is written and maintained by an amateur, and may contain bugs.

<h2 id = "howto">How to use ACME</h2>

 1. Download the repository as a zipped folder
 2. Extract the zipped folder
 3. Copy the folder named `acme` to your project filesystem
 4. Import ACME and the vector library in your C++ program
    ```c++
    #include "./path/to/acme/lib/vecN.hpp"
    #include "./path/to/acme/src/acme.hpp"
    ```
 5. Spend hours trying to understand how it works

Haha no.

I'll add one later, okay?
